## Configuration file for the run

RUN_NAME: testing123 # MUST be set. Creates a subfolder in the runs folder with this name, containing data, saved models, etc. IMPORTANT: all values in this folder WILL be deleted.
ASK_FOR_CONFIRMATION: True # If True, will ask for user configuration before running preprocessing, training, etc. If False, will just continue (useful for overnight runs)
RUN_FOLDER_OVERWRITE: None # None or string with folder where to save the run, which includes its data, etc. Using this does not add on the RUN_NAME to the end of the string. If relative, should be relative to the Petreanu_MEI_generation root folder. If none, defaults to: 'runs/RUN_NAME'

# Data parameters
data:
  keep_behavioral_info: False
  area_of_interest: 'PM' # None for all neurons, 'PM' for only PM neurons, 'V1' for only V1 neurons
  sessions_to_keep: 'all' # 'all' or list of sessions to keep, eg [['LPE10885', '2023_10_20'], ...]

  # Preprocessing
  INPUT_FOLDER: '../sensorium/notebooks/data/IM_prezipped' # Data input folder. For the raw data. If relative, should be relative to the Petreanu_MEI_generation root folder.

MEIs:

  session_id: 'LPE10885' # For which session id to generate MEIs. Currently set up to only do one at a time.
  session_date: '2023_10_20' # format: YYYY_MM_DD. For which session date to generate MEIs. Currently set up to only do one at a time.
  tier: 'all' # 'test', 'train', 'validation', 'final_test', or 'all'. Which tier of the data to select the neurons for MEI generation.
  also_output_to_local: False # Whether to also output the MEIs not just to the RUN_FOLDER, but also to a different output location. 
  local_output_folder: 'T:/Bonsai/lab-leopoldo-solene-vr/workflows/MEIs/'
  shape: [68, 135] # shape of the MEI. Needs to be a list of two integers.

dev:
  num_models: 5 # number of models to run, which are then used in the ensemble. Max: 5.
